Merge branch 'js/partial-urlmatch-2.17'

Recent updates broke parsing of "credential.<url>.<key>" where
<url> is not a full URL (e.g. [credential "https://"] helper = ...)
stopped working, which has been corrected.

* js/partial-urlmatch-2.17:
  credential: handle `credential.<partial-URL>.<key>` again
  credential: optionally allow partial URLs in credential_from_url_gently()
  credential: fix grammar
